# Testing markdown conversion

This is a little repository to test Markdown conversion. Usage:

1. Click "Use this template" at the top. This will prompt you to create a new repository of your own based on this one.
2. Go to your repository, edit the ``article.md`` file from within GitHub (click the file, then click the pen icon to edit it. You can preview what the markdown will look like when converted although the final output will be slightly different.
3. Commit your changes.
4. Go to the Actions tab in GitHub. There should be a "workflow run" with your commit description there, hopefully with a green tick (or soon it will have a green tick because it's a short script to run so it shouldn't take GitHub long to run it).
5. Click that run, and there should be a section "Artifacts" with "article-html". Click this to download a zip file of the article.
